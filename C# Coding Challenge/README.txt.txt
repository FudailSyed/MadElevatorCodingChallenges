C# Coding Challenge
Task 1: Data Processing You are given a CSV file that contains information about employees in a
company. Each row in the file represents an employee and contains the following columns: EmployeeId,
FirstName, LastName, Department, and Salary. Create a C# console application to read the CSV file,
parse its contents, and store the data in a collection (e.g., a list of custom employee objects).
Sample CSV File Data: employees.csv
EmployeeId,FirstName,LastName,Department,Salary
101,John,Doe,Engineering,75000
102,Jane,Smith,Marketing,60000
103,Bob,Johnson,Sales,80000
104,Alice,Williams,Engineering,70000
Task 2: Data Analysis Extend the existing application to perform the following data analysis tasks:
1. Calculate and display the total salary expenditure for each department.
2. Find and display the employee with the highest salary.
3. Calculate and display the average salary of all employees.
Task 3: Error Handling and File Validation Implement robust error handling in the application to handle
potential issues, such as:
1. Verify that the CSV file exists and is accessible before attempting to read it.
2. Ensure the CSV file follows the correct format with the required columns.
3. Handle any exceptions gracefully to prevent crashes and provide informative error messages to
the user.
Task 4: Additional File Operations Allow the user to add new employees to the existing CSV file by
entering their details (EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary). After adding a new
employee, update the data collection accordingly.

How to run:

Go to the terminal and open the directory (ex. cd Documents/C# Coding Challenge)

run the command: "dotnet run"

the first three lines before the start of the data will be error handling
